**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
  This course covered various data models I.e, including binary trees, hash tables, and linked lists, along with their suitable applications.
**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
  I aimed to comprehend the relative strengths and weaknesses of each data structure and utilized them when their advantages outweighed their disadvantages.
**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
  I resolved any challenges by consulting the official documentation for the method or searching for example implementations. Additionally, I occasionally created a simple prototype code element and gradually expanded it as the logic increased in complexity.
**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
  The project 1 analysis helped me consider performance and shaped my approach to algorithmic design. It also revealed that I don't think recursively, which is a weakness in some of my potential designs.
**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
  I believe that all of these aspects stem from practice. I've written enough file streams to have created a common function that I use as a prototype. I may also take several other elements I frequently reuse and develop them into libraries.
